			<h4>
			  License for the Text of the book
			</h4>
			<p>The license for the electronic edition of <em> The Hacker Crackdown</em> is effectively contained in the Preface to the release of the Electronic Edition and I reproduce it here:</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			"You can copy this electronic book.  Copy the heck out of it, be my
			guest, and give those copies to anybody who wants them.  The nascent
			world of cyberspace is full of sysadmins, teachers, trainers,
			cybrarians, netgurus, and various species of cybernetic activist.  If
			you're one of those people, I know about you, and I know the hassle you
			go through to try to help people learn about the electronic frontier.
			I hope that possessing this book in electronic form will lessen your
			troubles.  Granted, this treatment of our electronic social spectrum is
			not the ultimate in academic rigor.  And politically, it has something
			to offend and trouble almost everyone.  But hey, I'm told it's
			readable, and at least the price is right.
			</p>

			<p>
			You can upload the book onto bulletin board systems, or Internet nodes,
			or electronic discussion groups.  Go right ahead and do that, I am
			giving you express permission right now.  Enjoy yourself.
			</p>

			<p>
			You can put the book on disks and give the disks away, as long as you
			don't take any money for it.
			</p>

			<p>
			But this book is not public domain.  You can't copyright it in your own
			name.  I own the copyright.  Attempts to pirate this book and make
			money from selling it may involve you in a serious litigative snarl.
			Believe me, for the pittance you might wring out of such an action,
			it's really not worth it.  This book don't "belong" to you.  In an odd
			but very genuine way, I feel it doesn't "belong" to me, either.  It's a
			book about the people of cyberspace, and distributing it in this way is
			the best way I know to actually make this information available, freely
			and easily, to all the people of cyberspace&mdash;including people far
			outside the borders of the United States, who otherwise may never have
			a chance to see any edition of the book, and who may perhaps learn
			something useful from this strange story of distant, obscure, but
			portentous events in so-called "American cyberspace."
			</p>

			<p>
			This electronic book is now literary freeware.  It now belongs to the
			emergent realm of alternative information economics.  You have no right
			to make this electronic book part of the conventional flow of commerce.
			Let it be part of the flow of knowledge: there's a difference.  I've
			divided the book into four sections, so that it is less ungainly for
			upload and download; if there's a section of particular relevance to
			you and your colleagues, feel free to reproduce that one and skip the
			rest.
			</p>

			<p>
			Just make more when you need them, and give them to whoever might want
			them."
